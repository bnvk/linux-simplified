This is a rough overview of what I am setting out to accomplish with this repo / project. I would love feedback and help making it be better. Hopefully it is of help to others.

## Simple Problems

There are numerous types of Linux. These are called distributions or "distro" for short. There are [seven  popular distros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution#Popular_distributions) and even more built on top of these seven. There are also other, less popular, distros as well. Each distro comes with it's own quirks & ways of doing similar things. How to do a basic task can vary from distro to distro and version to version.

Due to the sprawling nature of Free Software, the idiosyncrasies of licensing / intellectual property and performance / engineering ideals - what comes pre-loaded or pre-set in one distro may or may not be in another distro. This inconsistency adds complexity for novice users.

Most Linux communities exist on time and work based donations from their users and a lot of the people who use Linux also help work on Linux. This often leads to expert users who forget the struggles of new users. A common theme with Free Software & Linux is that it is confusing and hard to use. Despite wonderful intentions, there are only so many hours in a day to donate, thus the time / donation aspect plays a factor in how usable Free Software is.

## Simple Solutions

That said, Linux is pretty awesome. It's absolutely amazing when you realize that community made tools actually come close to their corporate counterparts which cost millions of dollars to create and are often times not that much better, and in some cases worse. Additionally, Free Software is available to all, even those with no money.

However, the usability problem persists, limiting how many users can make significant use of Free Software. A common suggestion from experienced Linux users is often *"just search the web how to fix / do / update that thing."* After doing this for a handful of seconds (if you are lucky) or minutes (and sometimes hours) later a user has either figured out how to achieve their goal or given up in frustration. When in luck, the best results tend to be in the form of use blog posts, StackExchange threads, and project instructions.

#### Some Simple Suggestions

This git repo / project aims to improve the state of documentation and help more beginner users migrate to Linux, easier.

1. [Identify similarities](#identify-similarities) - find broad categorical issues / pain pints across popular Linux distros and document them
2. [Use existing documentation](#use-existing-documentation) - don't set out to write documentation from scratch, copy and re-factor existing tutorials
2. [Best practices](#best-practices) - create structure for different skill levels based on user personas and common tasks
3. [Comparative documentation](#comparitive-documentation) - utilize best practices and structures identified for documentation across multiple distros
4. [Better user experiences](#better-user-experiences) - condense, distill, and discover ideas from above research & documentation for better UX
5. [Help more people](#help-more-people) - feel empowered to use Free Software daily

Here are those five goals in further detail with more concrete courses of action and outlines:

#### 1. Identify similarities

- Installing Linux
- Updating Linux
- Installing apps (via package manager)
 - Basic use of package managers
 - Installing a package on your computer
 - Add a developer repo to your package manager
- Updating & removing apps (packages)
- Window managers
- Media playback
  - How to playback .mp3 and .mp4 files
  - How to playback .mov video files
- Making backups
- Sharing files with others
- Basic security & privacy
- Configuring custom networking
  - Using Bitmask for a VPN
- Customizing display & visual things
  - Improve font rendering

#### 2. Use existing Documentation

- A well written easy to follow blog post for a given distro + version like *"How To Greatly Improve Font Rendering In Fedora 20"*
- A well written thread on [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com) such as *"Installing a Debian package from source"*
- A well written install guide for a given app *"Bitmask for Linux (choose from 4 different distro + version combos)"*

#### 3. Best Practices

- Easy to follow navigation & information architecture
- Some form of search / filtering
- Simple steps & tasks specially tailored to each distribution
- Real use case examples- not hypothetical / filler copy
- Attention to (and stated) user skill levels for given tasks

#### 4. Comparative Documentation

- Document "How to do X" in multiple distros
- Keep things current and simplified across distros

#### 5. Better User Experiences

- If a particular step above is overly complicated, provide suggestions to shorten and improve it
- Create wirefreames / mockups to send to proper developer communities

#### 6. Help More People

- Help everday people to start using Linux to do their basic computing
- Keep track of success stories and pain points you encounter over & over
- Be awesome + have fun :D

The above is a rough first pass of what this sort of thing together *might* look like. This outline is based on my first hand experience of migrating from the cozy land of MacOS to Linux and difficulties encountered along the way. Ideal documentation would be as thorough & robust as a well written blog post. The goal being that overall this collection will be more well organized and cumulatively helpful than these things scattered all around the web.
